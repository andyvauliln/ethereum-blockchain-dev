# The genesis file explained

The first question is, if there is something popping up, google it!

You can check the yellow paper of ethereum.

Let's cover each of the keys in the genesis.json file

## mixHash

"A 256-bit hash which proves combined with the noance that a sufficient amount of computation has been carried out on this block; formally H_m"

In easier terms: Combined with the noance it proves that the proof of work is done POW

## Nonce

A 64 bit hash which proves combined with the mix hash that has a sufficient amount of computation that has been carried out on this block; formally H_n

easier terms: a hash that proves that a certain block has been mined

## Difficulty

A scala value corresponding to the difficulty level of block. Can be calculated from previous block diff level and timestamp.

Easier: The harder the diff. the harder to mine

## Coinbase

* An address (160-bin)
* Its set in the miner
* Where ether goes during miner
* Also called "benefitiary" or "etherbase"

## Timestamp

Scalar value equal to Unix time at blocks inception

* Used to verify order of blocks iwthin chain
* If time between two blocks is getting too long, the diff decreases, if time is shorter, difficulty is automatically increased.

## Parenthash

The keccat 256-bit hash of the parent block's heather, in its entirety, formally H_p

* It's a complete hash of the parent block header - including noance and mixHash
* It points to the parent blcok - the foundation of a block chain
* Only in the genesisBlock it can be 0

## gasLimit

Scalar value wqual to the current limit of gas expenditure per block

A number that stops too complex contracts from executing


## the rest?

* Alloc
    - Pre-allocate accounts with ether
* extractData
    - Optional data field
* And many more.....
