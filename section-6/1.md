# Different Phases of Development

The phases, including contracts and Web3 interaction with website, as well as project in general

## Project steps

### Sketch out idea

The process of doing projects:

* Write down what idea should do
* Hack up a prototype
* Write down a flow chart of how people interact
* Write down different functions, variables, interfaces


### Prototyping

* Do a quick and dirty prototype
* Use the testrpc / browser solidity
* Need a debugger? Use Ethereum Studio!
* Maybe you can abstract things - have several smaller contracts that build upon each other


### Lay out the testing

* Write unit-tests
    - Solidity tests
    - Javascript test cases
    - Use a testing framework!

Truffle has a lot of test frameworks - you can use scenarios, etc. It also comes pre-populated with a meta-coing project, which is an exercise with tests in solidity and javascript.

The javascript files are used to test solidity

### Implement

* Write your code so that test-cases are fullfiled
* Implement methods

### Deploy on test-net

* Deploy your code on the test-net
* Find "beta" users
    - Invite friends
* Try your own software
* Iterate until you are satisfied
    - Remember: code deployed once cannot be updated
        + Except you can make a fork of the chain...

**Once your code is out, it cannot be changed!**

### Deploy

* Let users know
* Give them instructions
    - Geth
    - MetaMask
* Marketing
