# Setup Mist Wallet

We will be using the mist wallet as this is the easiest way to get a wallet.

Wallet will be the tool that we'll use to store all our ethereum.

Let's go to [The Mist Github Page](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases) and download it.

When downloaded, open it and follow the steps.

We have to wait until the full blockchain is downloaded - which takes a LONG time...

If we want to run this with GETH, we first close the wallet, and we would open a terminal and just run

``` 
geth
```

This command will download the blockchain. Be patient.
