# Quickstart - HelloWorld Solidity

We are going to write and deploy in private network because it doesnt cost money, and we'll need it in the next lessons.

## Install

* Go Ethereum Client (Geth)
* Install MIST wallet
* Create Account
    - Define blockchain directory
* Mine Ether in private blockchain

## Geth

* We need to install ethereum from geth, 
    - In mac we just run: 
        + `brew tap ethereum/ethereum`
        + `brew install geth`
