# Software required

here we'll cover the software needed throughout the course.

In the next lectures there will be talks about the theory, which will be a good chance for the code to be downloaded.

We should start geth in the background:

* We need to add the --fast flag
    - Enables fast syncing through state downloads rather than downloading the full blockchain data.
    - This will reduce the size of the blockchain dramatically
    - Fast can only be used starting geth without having downloaded anything before
* Second flag is --cache
    - and is the amount of megabytes allocated for internal caching
    - Depends on ram memory

## Already downloaded some data?

* If you are at 50% or beloe, remove the chaindata directory and start over
    - ~/.ethereum on linux
    - ~/Library/Ethereum in OS X
    - /AppData/Roaming/Ethereum in Windows
* In these directories there are:
    - chaindata: product blockchain
    - testnet: test blockchain
    - keystore: your keys


## Once removed geth

Start it as

```
geth --fast --cache=1024
```

It will be around **11GB**.

# Necessary software

* Python 2.7
* SSL
* C++ Compiler
* A Shell (Bash)
* NodeJS and NPM
