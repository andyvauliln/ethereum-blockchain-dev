# Ethereum Name Service & Oraclize

Two key things to talk about

# Ethereum Name service

* Ethereum Name service - [ens.domains](http://ens.domains)
    - Making long addresses into a name
    - If you have a contract that runs an address and you want to interact with it, you are able to just type `mycontract.eth`
    - We're not gonna work with it, but worth checking out
    - Not like DNS, you register domain in an auction process
    - Domain will be yours for a bit and then it's resell again
    - Buying domains works as auction process
    - Can check out the docs

# Oraclize

Missing link to interact with other web APIs from contract.

Not possible to talk with web client, like web api, ect.

But Oraglize is able to make web apis

The way it works, is if you go to dev.oraclize.it, you can find developer centre, and in the code samples, you can see a way to import the oraclize API.

With oraclize you can make a new query, and you query an URL that will then call the callback which will get the resultset back.

The way it's working from development side it's easy to use and powerful.

Fees are 1 cent per url call.

It's posisble to do Wolfram alpha calls as well as other calls
