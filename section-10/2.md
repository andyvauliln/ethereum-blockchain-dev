# Different versions of Truffle

We will use truffle.

In order to start truffle we can do it in two ways.

With `truffle init`, where it starts all the contract and dependencies.

But the new truffle versions allow you to use any build tool you want.

It is also possible to initialise it with the `truffle init webpack` to have a fully webpack enabled project.

## Get Started

Let's start by running `truffle init webpack`. We can see it installs all the modules, etc.

Once it runs, it gives us a bunch of commands that can be used to run the project.

### TestRPC

We also want to start testrpc by doing `testrpc`. That will start the test network.

When you start it you are welcomed with 10 accounts and private keys.

## Running Truffle Tests

Now we can run `truffle test` to compile and test all the contracts.
