# Testing our wallet

We will first open a command line to initialize an empty truffle project (In this case not a webpack version).

```
truffle init
```

Then we head to our init truffle project, where we have our metacoin contract:

``` javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.4;

import "./ConvertLib.sol";

contract MetaCoin {
    mapping (address => uint) balances;

    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);

    function MetaCoin() {
        balances[tx.origin] = 10000;
    }

    function sendCoin(address receiver, uint amount) returns(bool sufficient) {
        if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[receiver] += amount;
        Transfer(msg.sender, receiver, amount);
        return true;
    }

    function getBalanceInEth(address addr) returns(uint){
        return ConvertLib.convert(getBalance(addr),2);
    }

    function getBalance(address addr) returns(uint) {
        return balances[addr];
    }
}

```

We also make sure we remove the code from the `migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js` so that it looks like:

``` javascript
module.exports = function(deployer) {};
```

Finally we remove all the tests.

## Adding contracts

Now we want to create all of our contracts within the `contracts` folder. We will have:

* mortal.sol
* owned.sol
* MyWallet.sol

In order to use the contracts within MyWallet.sol, we have to import it with `import "./contractname.sol`.

Now we are good.

Finally in our migrations, we have to add:

``` javascript
var myWallet = artifacts.require("./MyWallet.sol")

module.exports = function(deployer) {
    deployer.deploy(myWallet);
};
```

Now we go to the account and we run the tests:

```
testrpc

truffle compile

truffle migrate
```

When we have a look on our `testrpc` window we can see how truffle is sending the transactions. We are going to test it now.

We will write our first test. We call it `wallet.js`. In the wallet.js test, we get the following:

``` javascript
var wallet = artifacts.require("./MyWallet.sol");

contract("MyWallet", function(accounts) {
    it("should be possible to put money inside", function() {
        var contractInstance;

        return wallet.deployed().then(function(instance) {
            contractInstance = instance;

            return contractInstance.sendTransaction({
                value: web3.toWei(10, 'ether'),
                address: contractInstance.address,
                from: accounts[0]
            });
        }).then(function(tx) {
            console.log(tx);
        });
    });
});
```

We need that `return` statement to make sure the test is successful and it finishes.

# Testing

So we run with `truffle test`, and we can see that the test framework makes sure that there is a clean environment so it redeploys all the contracts.

We can see that it works, and we can even see inside the logs.

## Adding more stuff

We can actually start asserting, so we make sure stuff is equal, we can add in the last promise the followin:

``` javascript
assert.equal(web3.getBalance(contractInstance.address),
    web3.toWei(10, 'ether'), 'The balance is the same')
```

We added two more tests later. We send some ether to the bank account and check that the balance in the wallet has been substracted.

We need the confirmation from the owner that the sending was true. That it was still 5 ether or less.

If we go to our console, and we call truffle test, then it will compile contract, and test against the `testrpc`.

We should have the tests run through successfully.

For our next assignemtn we want to make sure that the confirmation function in the contract is working properly.
