# Listening to events

In the new chapter we have a few updates as we will be adding updates.

Our contract has several events:

* proposalReceived - we want to know if we received a proposal
* receivedFunds - when we receive funds from someone

So we start by adding a new row.

``` html

  <div class="row">
    <span id="addresses"></span>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <h3>Proposal received</h3>
      <div id="proposalEvents">

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <h3>Funds Received</h3>
      <div id="fundEvents">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

We make sure that our contracts are `compiled` and `migrated`.

We need to make sure that everything is pointing to the right addresses.

# Listen to events

The next part is in the javascript file to listen to events.

We will cretae a new function:

``` javascript
listenToEvents: function() {
    MyWallet.deployed.then(function(instance)) {
        instance.receiveFunds().watch(function(error, event) {
            document.getElementById("fundEvents").innerHTML += JSON.stringify(event);
        })
    })
}
```

Finally make sure that we call the listenToEvents function:

``` javascript
App.listenToEvents();
```

Now the next event is proposal received!

We can see that the proposals we can get the events. But the funds received events are not there, but we can get it by specifying the blocks we want to cover

```
{fromBlock: 0, toBlock: 'latest'}
```

In the proposal received we can filter by the indexed filters.
