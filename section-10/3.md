# Truffle Webpack Folder Structure

## App folder

Comes shipped with webpack folder. It comes with metacoin contract.

Inside you have everything taht you'd expect with frontends, such as css, etc.


## Contracts

The MetaCoin is a virtual coin contract with money / balance, and other functions.

## Migrations

Javascript config files that make sure contracts that depend on each other in the blockchain are deployed in the right order.

IE we have MetaCoin Depending on ConvertLib, so we need to make sure that they are in order.

## Tests

Two types, javascript and solidity.

Solidity are perfect to run in combination with TestRPC, as they will check if it's the same as the JS file.

When you deploy a new metacoin, that the balance has 10k metacoins.

You can write both tests in JS and solidity.

It can be triggered with `truffle test`

## package.json
