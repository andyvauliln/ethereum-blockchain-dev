# Let's implement our shared wallet

We will start by having two standard contracts  that will be inherited:

* owned
    - It provides the modifier onlyowner(), which checks if the sender is the owner
* mortal
    - Extends owned
    - Has a kill function
    - It's not anymore called suicide, it's called selfdestruct

now we can start coding our contract:

``` javascript
contract MyWallet is mortal {

    event receivedFunds(address indexed _from, uint256 _amount);
    event proposalReceived(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, string _reason)

    struct Proposal {
        address _from;
        address _to;
        uint256 _value;
        sttring _reason;
        bool sent;
    }

    uint proposal_counter;

    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) m_proposals;

    function spendMoneyOn(address _to, uint256 _value, string _reason) return (uint256) {
        if(owner == msg.sender) {
            bool sent = _to.send(_value);

            if(!sent) {
                throw;
            }
        }
        else {
            proposal_counter++;
            m_proposals[proposal_counter] = Proposal(msg.sender, _to, _value, _reason, false);
            proposalReceived(msg.sender, _to, _reason);

            return proposal_counter
        }
    }

    function payable() {
        if(msg.value > 0) {
            receivedFunds(msg.sender, msg.value);
        }
    }

    function confirmProposal(uint proposal_id) onlyowner returns(bool) {
        Proposal proposal = m_proposals[proposal_id]

        if(proposal._from != address(0)) {
            if(proposal.sent != true) {
                proposal.sent = true;

                if(proposal._to.send(proposal._value)) {
                    return true;
                }

                proposal.sent = false;
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
