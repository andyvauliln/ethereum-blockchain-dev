# Decentralisation

Decentralised = eliminates risk.

No central copy of the node exists.

5 steps of decentralised:

* Transaction process begins
* Transaction is sent through miner
* Transation is broadcast to other nodes
* Transaction is added to chain
* Recipient receives stuff

# Why is decentralisation good?

* No centralised failure
* Not as prone to hacking attacks
* Decision making is done as a whole
