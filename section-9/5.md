# Compile and deploy contract

We will compile a contract written in solidity and deploy it.

In the index.html file we have the same as in the previous function.

The only difference is that we don't have any contract, but we want to create the contract instance from the souce code.

So we'll take the contract and minify it to paste it as a variable in javascript:

``` javascript
var contractCode = "pragma solidity ^0.4.0; contract MyContract..."
```

We will have to access solidity to our geth console and run:

``` javascript
eth.getCompilers()
```

If we don't have it instaled let's install the Solidity compiler through the steps provided in the documentations.

Once we install it, we'll have all the executables in RelWithDebInfo, which **we need to make sure is in the path.** Once we restart geth, Solidity should be available.

## Compile button

We want to add a button that when clicked it will compile the contract and deploy to the blockchain.

``` html
<button onclick="getCount()">Deploy contract</button>
```

And we need the function as well:

``` javascript
function deployContract() {
    var compiled = web3.eth.compile.solidity(contractCode);
    console.log(compiled);
}
```

Now we can see that the javascript console prints the value successfully

We can see that the object printed has the code, ABI definition, etc. We will need those two specifically to deploy to the chain.

``` javascript
function deployContract() {
    var compiled = web3.eth.compile.solidity(contractCode);

    var code = compiled['<stdin>:MyContract'].code;
    var abi = compiled['<stdin>:MyContract'].info.abiDefinition;

    web3.personal.unlockAccount(web.eth.accounts[0], "password123")

    web3.eth.contract(abi).new({data: code, from: web3.eth.accounts[0]}, function(error, result) {
            if (error) {
                console.error(error);
            }
            else {
                if (result.address) {
                    contractInstance = result;
                    console.log(contractInstance)
                    document.getElementById("updateCounterButton").style.visibility = "visible";
                    document.getElementById("increaseCounterButton").style.visibility = "visible";
                }
            }
        });
}
```

We can see that when we run this we get an error as not enough gas is provided to the contract when running it.

So we either have to estimate the gas right, or just give it a much hihger one. In this case we just give it 3,000,000 gas

``` javascript
web3.eth.contract(abi).new({data: code, gas: 3000000, from: web3.eth.accounts[0]}
```

Now we acan see the transaction
