# Web3 use non-constant functions

Now we are going to implement the increase counter method.

We will call methonds on the contract - namely getNumber to see the value, and then setnumber.

Let's define the increasecounter function.

We also need to make sure that we unlock the account.

We also need to wait for the transaction to be mined before we can update our span with a new number.

If we call a function taht will send a transaction, we will have a callback function that we can give it.

Once the transaction is sent, we'll get the transaction hash into our callback function.

We can also give the setMyNumber function another object saying from where we want to send it to, as well as how much gas we want to send, etc.

``` javascript
function increaseCounter() {
    var currentNumber = contractInstance.getMyNumber().toNumber();
    currentNumber++;

    web3.personal.unlockAccount(web3.eth.accounts[0], "password123");

    contractInstance.setMyNumber(
        currentNumber, {
            from: web3.eth.counts[0],
            gas: 2000000
        },
        function(error, result) {
            if (error) {
                console.error(error);
            }
            else {
                var txHash = result;
                console.log(txHash);
            }
        });
}
```

But this won't work as it is, the error will say "the error personalunlockaccount does not exist"

So we need to go to our window where we're running geth, and run:

```
geth --datadir=./chaindata --rpc --rpccorsdomain "*" --rpcapi eth,web3,personal
```

The RPC API specifies the endpoints that we want to make available. Eth and web3 are standard, but we specify we also want the personal.

Now we can have another funciton that continuously asks the blockchain if transaction has been mined.

``` javascript
function callWhenMined(txHash, callback) {
    web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash, function(error, rcpt) {
            if (error) {
                console.error(error);
            }
            else {
                if(rcpt == null) {
                    setTimeout(function(){
                        callWhenMined(txHash, callback);
                    }, 500);
                }
                else {
                    callback();
                }
            }
        });
}
```

And we want to add in our increaseCounter function that function so we wait for the callback:

``` javascript
callWhenMined(txHash, getCounter);
```
