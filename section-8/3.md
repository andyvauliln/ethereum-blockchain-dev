# Constructor, setters, etc

Now we'll create our constructor that sets an unsigned integer as well as setter and getter:

``` javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract MyContract {

    uint = myVariable;

    function MyContract() {
        myVariable = 5;
    }

    function setMyVariable(uint myNewVariable) {
        myVariable = myNewVariable;
    }

    function getMyVariable() constant returns(uint) {
        return myVariable;
    }

}
```

**Constant functions can be called without spending any gas.**

We still have the pragma, the contract `MyContract`, a variable with `uint`, then the constructor that sets the variable to 5 upon contract creation. Then we have 2 variables.

## Side Panel

* Settings tab
    - Tells what compiler version, and other versions it has
    - Sees the bytecode, etc
* Transaction tab
    - gives us several accounts that we can choose as transaction origin
* Environment tab
    - We can choose whether we want javascript VM, when we create it
    - If we check web3, it would inject the web3 object so we can use it from wallet or metamask
    - We can choose web3 provider which let's you define RPC endpoint, you open a geth with RPC endpoint
    - Browser might deny access to endpoint because it's served by HTTP because resource is not safe
    - You can clone repo and serve without https
