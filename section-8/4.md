# Testing contract

We can test it with what we have on the panel in the right.

We have 2 buttons:

* At address
* Create
    - When we click it, it creates contract in virtual machine directly in browser
    - Simulates a blockchain
    - Tells us
        + Transaction cost
        + Execution cost
        + Contract address
        + Functions
            * Constant function has
                - Value (directtly visible)
            * Non-constant variable
                - We can interact with those functions
        + Constructor
            * Setting variable to 5 in this case
            * We can see that the value decoded is 5


If we play around with the non-constant `setMyVariable`, we are able to change the variable. It costed transaction gas and execution gas.
