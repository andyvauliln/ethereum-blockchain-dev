# Events

Very convenient way to access the ethereum VM.

They have a special location in blockchain, you can access them through javascript console.

If we want to create an event, we just have a keyword event, and define it.

We'll add an event that gets fired when an address is added to senders list:

``` javascript
event someoneAddedSomeoneToTheSendersList(
            address thePersonWhoAdded,
            address thePersonWhoIsAllowed,
            uint thisMuchHeCanSend);
```

The event can have several parameters, and can be indexed in the javascript part.

To hire an event we just create it:

``` javascript
someoneAddedSomeoneToTheSendersList(msg.sender, permitted, maxTransferAmount);
```

This can be tested in the browser, or in our private network.

We will want to extend our other functions with meaningful events, and test them in private geth network.

You can learn more about events in the documentation for solidity.
