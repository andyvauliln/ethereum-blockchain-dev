# Killing contracts + Modifiers

We can create a suicide function, which takes all the remaining funds and gas stored in contract:

``` javascript
function kill() {
    if(msg.sender == owner) {
        suicide(owner);
    }
    else {
        throw;
    }

}
```

**This gives everything stored in the contract to the owner, or whoever the param is.**

## Modifiers

Instead of having if/control funcitons, we can use modifiers:

``` javascript
modifier onlyowner() {
    if (owner == msg.sender) {

    }
    else {
        throw;
    }
}
```

The modifier is used to modify function, and puts the code in function where the underscore is.

Throw rolls back the changes and gives back funds to the person that ran the function.

We can add the modifers into the end of the functions:

``` javascript
function setMyVariable(uint myNewVaraible) onlyowner {
    myVariable = myNewVaraible;
}

function kill() onlyowner {
    suicide(owner)
}
```

## Testing it

So now we go to our panel in the right, we try setting the variable with the owner account, and then try with a different account.

When we try it with a different account we can see we get an error, talking about a wrong jump, this is caused by the exception.
