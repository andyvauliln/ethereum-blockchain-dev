# Structs, arrays, etc

Let's say we want to give someone a set of money every week for them to spend.

We will use our contract now with 10 ether that they can spend.

We not onyl want to give it 10 ether, but can also be selective to not allow them to expense to several addresses.

We also want to have a record that stores where the money has been transferred.

## Mappings

Mappings map stuf, like addresses to integers, etc.

In the most simple example, we might have a mapping that has address to integer

``` javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

import "github.com/..."

contract MyContract is mortal {

    uint myVariable;

    mappping(address -> uint) myAddressMapping;

    function MyContract() {
        myVariable = 5;

        myAddressMapping[msg.sender] = 1;
    }

    function setMyVariable(uint myNewVariable) {
        myVariable = myNewVariable;
    }

    function getMyVariable() constant returns(uint) {
        return myVariable;
    }

    function () payable {

    }

}
```

Sometimes we want to have different mappings. We may also want to have the address and something else that we might want to store. We might want to have a struct, where we can have more than 1 value on it.

Structs are a group of values:

``` javascript
mappping(address -> Permission) myAddressMapping;

struct Permission {
    bool isAllowed;
    uint maxTransferAmount;
}

function MyContract() {
    myVariable = 5;

    myAddressMapping[msg.sender] = Permission(true, 5);
}
```

The documentation has a deep information on all the types.


# SimpleWallet code

Now we start with the new skelleton

``` javascript
pragma solidity ...;

import "github.com/..."

contract SimpleWallet is mortal {

    mapping(address -> Permission) myAddressMapping;

    struct Permission {
        bool isAllowed;
        uint maxTransferAmount
    }

    function () payable {

    }
}
```

Now we need a function that allows us to permit addresses with max amounts

```  javascript
function addAddressToSendersList(address permitted, uint maxTransferAmount) onlyowner {
    myAddressMapping[permitted] = Permission(true, maxTransferAmount)
}
```

Now we need a function to send the funds

``` javascript
function sendFunds(address receiver, uint amountInWei) {
    if(myAddressMapping[msg.sender].isAllowed) {
        if(myAddressMapping[msg.sender].maxTransferAmount >= amountInWei) {
            receiver.send(amountInWei);
        }
    }
}

function removeAddressFromSendersList(address theAddress) {
    delete permittedAddresses[theAddress]
}
```

This would of course work only if the amount is enough in the wallet.

In this case you don't have to check whether variables are initialised.

The received is of type address, and address has two functions - balance and send. But in the future also has transfer.

Send always tries to send amount to receiver using money in contract.

Stack can't be deeper than 1024 levels.

We can actually check if the amount is sent:

``` javascript
bool amountSent = receiver.send(amount);
if(!amountSent){
    throw;
}
```

## Testing

If we use the side dashboard to transfer ether.

When we try to send the money, we see that we get an error, because we
