# Hands on Solidity

We are going to create a solidity contract from scratch that is like a wallet, can store some ether, and only owner of wallet can retreive ether, can add other people to wallet that can also retreive ether.

This would allow people to have say a weekly allowance, where she will be able to whithraw ether from the wallet, and the other people can whithraw money as well.

We will start with skelleton, then start going through events, maps, arrays, structs, and import other contracts.
