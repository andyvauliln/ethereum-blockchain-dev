# Extending / Importing contracts

It is possible to extent contracts from another contracts!

We can have another contract that has:

``` javascript
contract mortal {
    address owner;

    modifier onlyowner() {
        if (owner == msg.sender) {
            _;
        }
        else {
            throw;
        }
    }

    function mortal() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function kill() onlyowner {
        suicide(owner)
    }
}
```

Now we can inherit/extend that contract by just using the "is" keyword

``` javascript
contract MyContract is payable {

}
```

This automatically extends all the functions from one contract to the other.

That means that we can remove several functions, having a much ligher function.

## Different files

And now we can actually create a different file completely, and import the other contract by using:

``` javascript
import "mortal.sol"
```

Now we have contracts, inheritance, and import statements

But we can also host our contracts in places like github and import it directly from there.

Solidity and ethereum are trying to establish a node package manager called **EthPM**.

We want to learn to import files.

So to import from github we use:

``` javascript
import "github.com/ethereum/solidity/std/mortal.sol"
```

We will be able to import it how we use other contracts.
