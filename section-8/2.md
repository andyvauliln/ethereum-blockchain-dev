## General layout

Contract is comparable to a class.

you start it by typing `contract` and name:

``` javasript
contract MyContract {

}
```

If typing in the browser solitiy, it would complain because it requires to define the version of the solidity, which would need at the top:

``` javascript
pragma Solidity ^0.4.0;
```

This is the basics of contracts
